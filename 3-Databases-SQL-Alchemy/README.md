## Introduction to ORM

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, a technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented programming languages. It bridges the gap between the object-oriented world of Python and the relational world of databases, making it easier to work with databases in your application.

### Key Benefits of ORM:
- **Abstraction**: ORM provides a higher-level, more abstract way to interact with the database, reducing the need to write raw SQL queries.
- **Database Independence**: You can switch between different database systems (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) without changing your application code.
- **Improved Productivity**: ORM simplifies database operations, leading to faster development and maintenance of applications.
- **Object-Oriented Approach**: You can work with database records as objects, making the code more readable and maintainable.

## Installation

To get started with this example, you'll need to have Python and SQLAlchemy installed. If you haven't already, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
